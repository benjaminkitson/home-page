  description1: "Hi, I'm Benjamin, a full-stack web developer and musician from London, UK! I'm a self-professed addict to both creative projects and problem solving, preferably both at the same time.",
  description2: "After unceremoniously terminating my study of Chemical Engineering in 2016, I took up the challenge of a music degree, having had almost no formal music training beforehand. Since then, I\'ve done a ski season, written and recorded my first EP for my studio project The Parallax Effect, completed my music degree with first-class honours, completed the Web Development bootcamp at Le Wagon, created a range of entertaining projects with JavaScript, worked as a volunteer JavaScript developer, and landed my first developer job at Andertons Music.",
  description3: "If you run a business and are looking to have a fast, modern website built, I\'d love it if you got in touch! If you're an aspiring Junior Developer, feel free to send me a message - I reckon I have some useful ideas on the approach you could be taking. If you\'re neither of those things, feel free to get in touch anyway, and I\'d love it if you took a look at the various bits and pieces that I\'ve created over on the projects page."
